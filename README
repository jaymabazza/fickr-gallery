Simple Flickr Gallery test as required by Yahoo7.

Background:
- This app demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, Javascript and NodeJS without thirdparty libraries and/or frameworks. All organic, no preservatives.

Tech:
- Nodejs: serves all the files and API requests.
- HTML: renders our app's view
- CSS: makes the app sexy
- Javascript: handles xhr calls to/from Node

Running the app:
- Extract the zip file.
- run node flickr.js in your command line (example: "node /location/unzipped/flickr.js")
- open http://localhost:8888 in your favorite browser

Configuration:
- If we want to increase the results (number of pictures per page), open flickr.js, then modify the value of:
	* 'per_page' : 5
- If we want to increase the pagination link (default 10 links), open js/scripts.js, in `render_nav` function, change:
	* var page_btn_count = 10
